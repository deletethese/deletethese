# 🛠️ DELETE

Welcome to the edge — where limits are meant to be broken.

##  Who Am I?

I’m not here to fit in. I’m here to **experiment, explore, and execute**.  
From chaotic creativity to clean code, from tech hacks to raw thoughts — I dive headfirst into everything **hard-core**.

- 🔥 Obsessive about pushing boundaries.
- 🧪 Constantly experimenting — no rules, no apologies.
- ⚙️ Tech, art, life — all fair game for my curiosity.

##  What to Expect

> “Normal is boring. Safe is dead. Delete is evolution.”

- Raw experiments & weird builds  
- Thought-dumps that sound like manifestos  
- Unfiltered insights & projects that break molds  
- Occasional chaos (on purpose)

##  Philosophy

> **Try everything. Break most. Keep what’s worth it.**  
> Life’s an open-source experiment — I just chose to commit hard.

##  Tools, Skills & Toybox

- Code, AI, music, design, hardware — anything that sparks curiosity.
- I don't master tools — I **bend them** until they break.

##  Wanna Connect?
